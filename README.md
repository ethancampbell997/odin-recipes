# odin-recipes
First project from Odin Project
Author: Ethan Campbell
Project: Create a website that displays 3 different recipes. The 
homepage should link to each recipe. The ingredients should be in an 
unordered list and the steps should be in an ordered list.
Reflection: This project helped me undertand many aspects of HTML.
I found that it was easy to forget things like the README, alts on
images and "noopener" and "noreference" on links.
This project was a great introduction and showed me things to focus
on.
